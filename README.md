# Chip-8 Emulator

## Overview
Chip-8 is an interpreted programming language that was created in the 1970s for use on the COSMAC VIP and similar microcomputers. It is known for its simplicity and is often used for educational purposes to teach programming concepts and emulator development.

## Project Structure
- **src/**: Contains the source code for the emulator.
- **include/**: Header files for the project.
- **bin/**: Compiled binaries of the emulator.
- **lib/**: Libraries used in the project.

## SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)
SDL is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low-level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D. It is widely used in game development and multimedia applications. SDL simplifies the process of creating games and applications that run on multiple platforms, making it an ideal choice for projects like the Chip-8 emulator.

## Project Status
This project is currently under development. The emulator is not yet fully functional, and additional features and optimizations are planned for future updates.
